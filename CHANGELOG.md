## [3.1.2] - 2022-03-03

### Added

- TypeScript types file ([#114](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/114))

### Updated

- Updated dependencies and changed build-related settings to be consistent with Esri Leaflet ([#122](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/122))

## [3.1.1] - 2021-11-09

### Fixed

- Map panning was broken in some environments due to a specific `mapbox-gl-js` version. Pinning this library's `package.json` specifically to `mapbox-gl-js v1.13.1` fixes the issue. [#105](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/105)

## [3.1.0] - 2021-08-09

### Added

- `L.esri.Vector.vectorTileLayer` has been extended to support vector tiles layers hosted in ArcGIS Enterprise. A new `portalUrl` layer constructor option was added and is intended to be used with the "ITEM_ID" constructor flavor. [#97](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/97)

- New README documentation and a developer console warning for `L.esri.Vector.vectorTileLayer` explaining that only services with a Web Mercator `spatialReference` are fully supported. [#95](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/95)

- Updated peerDependencies to be more flexible for using v3 of `esri-leaflet`. [#99](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/99)

### Fixed

- Utility functions used by `L.esri.Vector.vectorTileLayer` have been improved to be more friendly with URL structures and style reformatting assumptions. [#100](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/100)

## [3.0.1] - 2021-06-03

### Fixed

- While formatting the style object when loading a new `L.esri.Vector.vectorTileLayer`, check first if layer layout property exists before accessing. (üôèjag-eagle-technologyüôè [#70](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/70))

- Support style items with non-esri source names. [#91](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/91)

### Changed

- The layer constructor option `apikey` in all lowercase is now supported **and encouraged** in order to be consistent with the rest of esri-leaflet's ecosystem. Note that camel case `apiKey` continues to be allowed since [3.0.0]. [#89](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-vector/pull/89)

## [3.0.0] - 2021-01-25

### Breaking

- `L.esri.Vector.basemap` is now `L.esri.Vector.vectorBasemapLayer` and requires an API key (`apiKey`) or token (`token`).
- `L.esri.Vector.layer` is now `L.esri.Vector.vectorTileLayer`.
- Simplified imports. `mapbox-gl-js v1` continues to be a depedency but is bundled internally with production builds.

  <!-- Leaflet -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet/dist/leaflet.css" />

## [2.0.0]

### Changed

### Added

- Esri's [OpenStreetMap Vector basemap](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-living-atlas/mapping/new-osm-vector-basemap/)

### Breaking Change

- `mapbox-gl-js` is now an external dependency. it is no longer bundled internally.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/mapbox-gl/dist/mapbox-gl.css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mapbox-gl/dist/mapbox-gl.js"></script>

## [1.0.5]

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression which caused `L.esri.Vector.Layer` not to honor custom styles applied to generic Esri hosted vector tilesets (example [item](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=bd505ce3efff479bb4e87b182f180159))

## [1.0.4]

### Added

- `L.esri.Vector.layer` can now be used to display Vector Tile Services published using ArcGIS Pro. (like [this one](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0bac0ffdc8634d9a9bc662bb8fa7547d))

## [1.0.3]

### Added

- `L.esri.Vector.layer` object added so that developers can point at any arbitrary ArcGIS Online hosted vector tile source

### Fixed

- trapped situation in which vector style json defines path of sprites/glyphs using fully qualified paths.

### Changed

- made dependency on Leaflet fixed at `1.0.0-beta.2` (until [#47](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-leaflet/issues/47) is resolved)
- started linting all the `.js` in the repo

## [1.0.2]

### Fixed

- Added three new Vector basemaps. [Mid-Century](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=763884983d3544c0a418a97992881fce), [Newspaper](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=4f4843d99c34436f82920932317893ae) and [Spring](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=267f44f08a844c7abee2b62b00600540).
